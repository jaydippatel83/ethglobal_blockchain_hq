### BlockchainHQ is the ultimate super app for builders to contribute, collaborate, and unlock opportunities in the Web3 space.

### Q&A - Builders can ask questions, contribute by answering, and earn on-chain reputation scores and attestations for their contributions through the Sign Protocol.
### Gigs & Work - A trustless marketplace powered by smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries. To ensure fair behavior, both parties (buyer and seller) must stake crypto assets, demonstrating their commitment and accountability.
### Builders Point - A dedicated space where builders and teams can create "Request for Contribution" posts, including:

1) Recruiting early beta testers for their startup
2) Seeking feedback and suggestions or constructive criticism with Roast My DApp
3) Conducting user research interviews
4) Proposing team collaboration or co-founder opportunities
5) Finding content writers and educators
6) Requesting media coverage
